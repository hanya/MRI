MRI can show elements of a struct and gets their value.

== Properties Scope ==

Structs is not UNO object and they have only element attribute. So, MRI shows structs' element in the Properties scope.

For example, com.sun.star.lang.Locale struct is shown like this below.

{|
|Name||Value Type||Value||Mode
|-
|Country||string||US||
|-
|Language||string||en||
|-
|Variant||string||""||
|}

You can get a value of an element by the double clicking on the information edit.

== Services Scope ==

Structs do not supports any services but MRI shows structs name in the information edit at the Services scope. This behavior allows to open its IDL Reference page.
